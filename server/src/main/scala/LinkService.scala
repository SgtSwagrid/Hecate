/**
  * A service that previews and follows invite links. A link to a group joins
  * it; a link to a resource grants its access, never lowering what the follower
  * holds. The host makes links to its resources through [[LinkStore]].
  *
  * Codes are short enough to guess, so a user who tries too many that lead
  * nowhere within `window` finds every code leads nowhere until it passes.
  * Strangers following links as guests share one allowance, and once it is
  * spent are told guests are paused. The counts are kept in memory.
  *
  * @param links
  *   The store of links.
  *
  * @param groups
  *   The store of groups.
  *
  * @param grants
  *   The store of grants.
  *
  * @param db
  *   The database the stores use.
  *
  * @param resources
  *   The lookup of a resource's name that locks its row until the transaction
  *   ends, yielding `None` for a missing resource. It runs in the transaction
  *   following a link, so the access granted cannot outlive the resource (see
  *   [[GrantStore.revokeOver]]). The default knows no resources.
  *
  * @param report
  *   The handler of failures whose detail must not reach the client.
  *
  * @param guesses
  *   The number of codes leading nowhere one user may try within `window`.
  *
  * @param window
  *   The time a code that led nowhere counts against its tryer.
  *
  * @param affected
  *   The hook told whom a followed link concerns (see [[Affected]]).
  *
  * @param guests
  *   The service that makes guests, letting strangers follow links as one, or
  *   `None`. Its [[AuthPolicy.guests]] must allow them too.
  *
  * @param strangerGuesses
  *   The number of codes leading nowhere all guests together may try within
  *   `window`.
