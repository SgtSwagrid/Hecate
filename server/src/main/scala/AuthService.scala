/**
  * A service for accounts and sign-in sessions: registration, guests, sign-in
  * and sign-out, passwords, recovery, email addresses and account deletion. It
  * also resolves session tokens to users for every request needing one.
  *
  * It knows nothing of HTTP: a request that opens or ends a session answers
  * with the [[SessionCookie]] to set. `hecate-server-tapir` serves each method
  * as an endpoint.
  *
  * @param users
  *   The store of users, sessions and recovery codes.
  *
  * @param policy
  *   The rules for sessions, passwords and mail.
  *
  * @param accounts
  *   The store that deletes accounts, or `None` to refuse deletion. Give one
  *   only once the host's cascade removes everything of a user's.
  *
  * @param mailing
  *   The composer of mail, or `None` to refuse every request about email
  *   addresses and forgotten passwords.
  *
  * @param report
  *   The handler of failures whose detail must not reach the client. The
  *   default prints to the console.
  *
  * @param affected
  *   The hook told whom each committed change concerns (see [[Affected]]).
