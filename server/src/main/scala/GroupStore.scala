/**
  * A store of user groups, their memberships, invitations and requests to join,
  * and of the principals each user acts as.
  *
  * A group is a resource ([[Resource.group]]), and grants over it decide who
  * manages it: [[Access.View]] to see who is in it, [[Access.Edit]] to change
  * that and the group itself, and [[Access.Own]] to delete it and choose who
  * manages it, which [[SharingService]] does as for any resource. Its creator
  * first holds `Own`. Below the level an action needs, a group is reported
  * missing. Its direct members see it, its owners and one another, but only its
  * managers see who is invited or asking to join. Nobody joins without both
  * their own and a manager's agreement: by accepting an invitation, by having a
  * request admitted, or by following an invite link. A request may only be made
  * of a group the asker can see, a public one or one nested inside a group they
  * are a member of; any other is reported as missing. A group never contains
  * itself, and every walk of the tree visits each group once.
  *
  * Every change to a group's members, invitations, requests or invite link
  * first locks the group's row, as its check-then-insert races under
  * `READ COMMITTED` otherwise. Any new change of this kind must take the same
  * lock. Several groups are locked in one statement in ascending order of
  * identifier, so that two transactions cannot deadlock.
  *
  * @param tables
  *   The tables to store the groups in.
  *
  * @param db
  *   The database to run queries against.
  *
  * @param cascade
  *   The hook deleting the host's rows for groups about to be deleted, run in
  *   the same transaction before the groups go. The groups' grants are revoked
  *   by this store.
  *
  * @param resources
  *   The lookup of a resource's name that locks its row until the transaction
  *   ends, yielding `None` for a missing resource, as for [[LinkService]]. A
  *   deleted group's resources pass to whoever deleted it under these locks.
  *   Groups are looked up by this store itself (see [[named]]). The default
  *   locks nothing and finds every resource.
  *
  * @param operators
  *   The email addresses of the users who act for the system
  *   ([[Principal.System]]), matched in any case, and only once confirmed.
