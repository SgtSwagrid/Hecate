/**
  * A service that lets a resource's owners see and change who holds it, and
  * manage its invite link. A resource is never left with nobody holding
  * [[Access.Own]], no link grants [[Access.Own]], and only a principal the
  * owner may address ([[GroupStore.mayAddress]]) is granted anything. Every
  * change locks the resource's row first, through `resources`, so that two
  * owners giving up ownership at once cannot each see the other still holding
  * it.
  *
  * @param grants
  *   The store of grants.
  *
  * @param links
  *   The store of invite links.
  *
  * @param groups
  *   The store of groups.
  *
  * @param db
  *   The database the stores use.
  *
  * @param resources
  *   The lookup of a resource's name that locks its row until the transaction
  *   ends, yielding `None` for a missing resource, as for [[LinkService]].
  *
  * @param access
  *   The host's resolution of a user's access to a resource, or `None` for
  *   stored grants alone ([[Permissions.access]]).
  *
  * @param report
  *   The handler of failures whose detail must not reach the client.
  *
  * @param affected
  *   The hook told whom each committed change concerns (see [[Affected]]).
